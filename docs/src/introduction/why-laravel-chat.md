# Why Laravel Chat?

Laravel Chat makes it super easy to add messaging features to your Laravel app.

Instead of spending weeks building everything from scratch (like message storage, read & unread , file uploads, and real-time events), this package gives you all the tools out of the box, so you can focus on your app.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

Building chat from scratch means:

- Handling complex real-time events
- Managing database relationships for messages, users, and channels
- Keeping track of read/unread messages
- Supporting file uploads (locally or on S3)
- Encrypting and securing message content

It’s all handled for you just install, configure, and go.
